  2. To start designing your product, run /product-vision in this Claude Code session

  Would you like me to run /product-vision to begin defining your product?

> yes run it 

⏺ /design-os:product-vision

⏺ I'd love to help you define your product vision. Tell me about the product you're building - share any notes, ideas, or rough thoughts you have. What problem are you trying to solve? Who is it for?

  Don't worry about structure yet, just share what's on your mind.

> It's a social listening product. It is used for several use cases. 
Primarily monitoring the brand and its presence and along with the reaction 
it gets. This product scans through the internet, especially social media, 
with valid connections to social media using the authenticated APIs from the
 social channels and gets conversations that are directed to a particular 
brand. It also scans through the internet via keyword searches and gets 
conversations of the brand based on this keyword search as well.

Once it enters my product, the product does a lot of enrichments for the 
incoming mentions as we call it. It starts from sentiment analysis to 
classification of the customer intent and a lot of custom classifications 
that the user can set up themselves.

And then my primary use case is the social media customer care where the 
application is automatically ticketizing the incoming conversation. Bundling
 these conversations from the same user inside one ticket and it works as 
any regular help desk ticketing case management software does after.

Then I have the use case for analytics where I can look at analytics of what
 the customers are talking about. My brand or in comparison with my 
competition brands which also I can set up who is my competition and their 
social mentions and their web mentions flow in under the bucket of 
competition so that I can do some analysis of competition benchmarking or 
competitive intelligence as well.

And I have the third use case is presence management of the brand where I 
can publish content to social media and these are my core pillars of the 
application. 

⏺ This is a robust platform - a unified social listening, customer care, and brand management solution. You've got three clear pillars: monitoring & enrichment, social customer care with ticketing, and publishing/presence management, plus competitive intelligence woven throughout.

  Let me ask a few clarifying questions to shape this:
                                                                           
⏺ User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · What would you like to call this product? (A short, memorable name) →
      Locobuzz CX
     · Who is the primary user of this product? → Both equally

⏺ Locobuzz CX - great name that captures the CX (customer experience) focus.

  A couple more questions to sharpen the vision:
                                                                           
⏺ User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · What's the single biggest pain point Locobuzz CX addresses compared 
     to how teams handle this today? → All the above
     · What makes Locobuzz CX different from competitors like Sprinklr, 
     Sprout Social, or Hootsuite? → Flexibility, Ticketing depth, AI-powered
      enrichment

⏺ Excellent. You're solving multiple pain points with a platform that stands out through AI-powered enrichment, enterprise-grade ticketing, and flexibility/customization.

  Here's what I'm capturing for Locobuzz CX:

  ---
  Description:
  Locobuzz CX is a unified social listening, customer care, and brand management platform that helps marketing and customer care teams monitor brand conversations across social media and the web, respond to customers through intelligent ticketing, and publish content—all from one place.

  Problems & Solutions:

  1. Fragmented tools → One unified platform for listening, ticketing, analytics, and publishing eliminates tool sprawl
  2. Missed conversations → Authenticated API connections + keyword scanning ensure no mention goes unnoticed
  3. Slow response times → AI-powered auto-ticketing and conversation bundling accelerate customer care workflows
  4. Lack of insights → Sentiment analysis, intent classification, and competitive benchmarking provide actionable intelligence

  Key Features:
  - Social listening via authenticated APIs and web keyword scanning
  - AI-powered enrichment (sentiment, intent, custom classifications)
  - Automated ticketing with conversation bundling
  - Help desk-style case management
  - Competitive intelligence and benchmarking
  - Analytics dashboards
  - Social media publishing and presence management

  ---
  Does this capture your vision? Would you like to adjust anything?

> Another problem statement I actually want to capture is how every CX 
product is always missing that last mile customization for how it needs to 
adapt to your flow of work. And how CX or everything around the customer 
operations touches almost every part of the organization and how can we 
bring in more people in the flow of customers' work easily and contextually.
 This is something I would like to bring in. As a problem and solution 
statement. LocoBuzz can connect with your work management systems and hand 
off work arising out of customer conversation to the right team members. May
 be using email as a common denominator or any other work management systems
 with an integration. And hand off work to the right teams with the right 
context and bring in the updates from them back into the customer 
conversation thread for an internal viewing purpose. To be crafted as a good
 response to the customer upon resolution or any other such updates.

Another thing I would like to also talk about is customer experience 
management is largely moving to an agent tick workflow shift and LocoBuzz 
needs to be ready. It needs to be built in such a way that AI is ambient for
 co-pilot AI is automated for many tasks and AI is reading and understanding
 every move you are making so that it can mimic it in your absence or upon 
your specific authorization and command for it to do so. 

⏺ These are powerful additions - you're addressing two critical gaps in the market:

  1. The "last mile" collaboration problem - CX touches the whole org, but work handoffs are broken
  2. The agentic AI shift - CX is moving from tool-assisted to AI-driven workflows

  Here's the updated vision for Locobuzz CX:

  ---
  Description:
  Locobuzz CX is a unified, AI-native social listening, customer care, and brand management platform that helps marketing and customer care teams monitor brand conversations, respond through intelligent ticketing, collaborate across the organization, and publish content—all powered by ambient AI that learns and acts on your behalf.

  Problems & Solutions:

  1. Fragmented tools → One unified platform for listening, ticketing, analytics, and publishing eliminates tool sprawl
  2. Missed conversations → Authenticated API connections + keyword scanning ensure no mention goes unnoticed
  3. Slow response times → AI-powered auto-ticketing and conversation bundling accelerate customer care workflows
  4. Lack of insights → Sentiment analysis, intent classification, and competitive benchmarking provide actionable intelligence
  5. Broken cross-team handoffs → Integrations with work management systems (email, project tools) hand off customer-originated tasks to the right teams with full context, and bring updates back into the conversation thread for crafting informed responses
  6. CX tools aren't ready for agentic AI → Built AI-native from the ground up—ambient co-pilot assistance, automated task execution, and AI that learns from your actions to work autonomously when authorized

  Key Features:
  - Social listening via authenticated APIs and web keyword scanning
  - AI-powered enrichment (sentiment, intent, custom classifications)
  - Automated ticketing with conversation bundling
  - Help desk-style case management
  - Work handoff integrations (email, work management systems)
  - Contextual updates flowing back into conversation threads
  - Ambient AI co-pilot across all workflows
  - AI automation that learns and mimics user actions
  - Competitive intelligence and benchmarking
  - Analytics dashboards
  - Social media publishing and presence management

  Does this fully capture your vision now? Any tweaks before I save it?

> I think you missed my important concept. We also want to build a no-code 
CX platform which is composable from a UI perspective for teams to have the 
best functional information to talk to a customer at any given point in time
 with helpful information shown to them contextually and composable 
workflows, composable agent flows, and composable reports and insights work.
 

⏺ You're right - that's a foundational differentiator. The no-code, composable architecture is what actually enables the "last mile customization" you mentioned. Let me weave this in properly:

  ---
  Description:
  Locobuzz CX is a unified, AI-native, and fully composable social listening, customer care, and brand management platform. Marketing and customer care teams can monitor brand conversations, respond through intelligent ticketing, collaborate across the organization, and publish content—all on a no-code platform where UI, workflows, agent flows, and analytics can be composed to fit exactly how each team works.

  Problems & Solutions:

  1. Fragmented tools → One unified platform for listening, ticketing, analytics, and publishing eliminates tool sprawl
  2. Missed conversations → Authenticated API connections + keyword scanning ensure no mention goes unnoticed
  3. Slow response times → AI-powered auto-ticketing and conversation bundling accelerate customer care workflows
  4. Lack of insights → Sentiment analysis, intent classification, and competitive benchmarking provide actionable intelligence
  5. Broken cross-team handoffs → Integrations with work management systems hand off customer-originated tasks to the right teams with full context, and bring updates back into the conversation thread for crafting informed responses
  6. CX tools aren't ready for agentic AI → Built AI-native from the ground up—ambient co-pilot assistance, automated task execution, and AI that learns from your actions to work autonomously when authorized
  7. Every CX tool misses last-mile customization → A no-code, composable platform where teams build their own UI layouts, workflows, AI agent flows, and reports—so the tool adapts to your work, not the other way around

  Key Features:
  - Composable UI - Build contextual workspaces with exactly the information agents need
  - Composable workflows - No-code workflow builder for any process
  - Composable AI agent flows - Design how AI assists, automates, and learns
  - Composable reports & insights - Build custom analytics dashboards

  - Help desk-style case management
  - Work handoff integrations (email, work management systems)
  - Ambient AI co-pilot across all workflows
  - Competitive intelligence and benchmarking
  - Social media publishing and presence management

  ---
  Does this capture the full vision now?

> I just want to capture this up. It's a notion like software from a 
usability standpoint and the design aesthetics. And the functionality of 
being able to customize your panel of work and view data in many shapes, 
such as tables or cards or feed. Notion, Airtable Smart Suite, and Click Up 
do. 

⏺ Got it - the Notion/Airtable-style UX is the design philosophy behind the composability. Modern, flexible, beautiful - where users customize their workspace and view data however they need it.

  Here's the final draft:

  ---

⏺ Based on your product overview, I'd suggest breaking Locobuzz CX into these sections:

  1. Listening & Inbox — The unified mention stream where all social and web conversations land, with composable views (tables, cards, feeds) and AI-powered enrichment
  2. Customer Care — Help desk-style ticketing with auto-ticketing, conversation bundling, and agent workspace for handling customer inquiries
  3. Insights & Analytics — Composable dashboards for sentiment trends, intent analysis, competitive benchmarking, and custom reports
  4. Publishing — Social media content publishing and brand presence management across channels
  5. Workflows & Integrations — No-code workflow builder, AI agent configuration, and work handoff integrations with external systems

  These are ordered by logical development sequence. Listening & Inbox is the foundation—everything flows from ingested mentions. Customer Care and Insights build on that data. Publishing is a parallel capability. Workflows & Integrations ties everything together with automation and external connections.
                                                                           
⏺ User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · Does this breakdown make sense? Would you like to adjust any sections
      or their order? → There is a very important section which is the 
     settings or configuration. 

⏺ Good catch — Settings/Configuration is critical for a platform this customizable. Here's the updated breakdown:

  1. Listening & Inbox — The unified mention stream where all social and web conversations land, with composable views and AI-powered enrichment
  2. Customer Care — Help desk-style ticketing with auto-ticketing, conversation bundling, and agent workspace for handling customer inquiries
  3. Insights & Analytics — Composable dashboards for sentiment trends, intent analysis, competitive benchmarking, and custom reports
  4. Publishing — Social media content publishing and brand presence management across channels
  5. Workflows & Integrations — No-code workflow builder, AI agent configuration, and work handoff integrations with external systems
  6. Settings & Configuration — Brand setup, social channel connections, AI enrichment rules, custom classifications, user/team management, and workspace preferences

⏺ Based on your product vision and roadmap, I can see you're building Locobuzz CX with sections for Listening & Inbox, Customer Care, Insights & Analytics, Publishing, Workflows & Integrations, and Settings & Configuration.

  Let me help you define the core data model — the main "things" your app will work with.

  Looking at your product, here are the entities I'm seeing:

  - Mention — An incoming conversation or post about a brand, captured from social media or the web
  - Ticket — A customer care case created from one or more mentions, assigned to agents
  - Brand — A monitored brand (your own or competitors) with associated keywords and channels
  - Channel — A connected social media platform or web source (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, etc.)
  - Contact — A person who interacts with the brand (the customer behind mentions)
  - User — A team member using the platform (agent, manager, marketer)
  - Team — A group of users with shared permissions and assignments
  - Workspace — A composable view configuration (layouts, filters, columns)
  - Workflow — An automation definition with triggers, conditions, and actions
  - Post — Published content sent to social media channels
  - Report — A saved analytics dashboard or insight view
  - Classification — A custom tag or category applied to mentions (beyond sentiment/intent)

  Does this capture the main things your app works with? What would you add, remove, or change?

> I like what you have written, but I have some additions.

Under the channel, we have another entity called "page". This refers to the 
social media page where this activity of mentions is happening. It's 
naturally connected to tickets.

We have one more called "author". Author is the customer's representation on
 social media. It connects to a contact or a customer record. A customer is 
basically a collection of authors that have been identified as same (mostly 
with having the same phone number or email address). Once obtained, can 
become one contact, and that contact has multiple author profiles to 
represent their social media presence.

Then we have another entity which resides under a brand called "location 
profile". These entities represent a particular location and it can have a 
GMB location linked or a survey form linked to it which can be displayed as 
a QR code. All survey form fills become a mention in within Locobuzz, then 
it can have its own social media pages if it is on a location level. Every 
other review channel that we can add to get location specific reviews can be
 nested under this entity. Then there can be some rules that are applied 
across the brand entity for presence of a particular keyword in a mention 
that can be used to determine if this belongs to a particular location or 
not. This can be just keywords or it can also be AI-led enrichments that can
 be leveraged to determine if an incoming mention at a brand level through 
general social mentions or web mentions can be triangulated or associated to
 a location.

Then we have product profiles (similar to locations). You can now think of 
products having their own entity. Under this, you can have product reviews, 
it can have product social pages, and this can be applied to a brand post 
that a brand does at a brand level social page, but it is being done to 
promote the product. 

⏺ These are important additions that add real depth to the model. Let me make sure I understand the relationships:
                                                                           
⏺ User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · For the Author → Contact relationship: Can an Author exist without 
     being linked to a Contact yet (unidentified), or is a Contact always 
     created for every Author? → Always creates Contact
     · For Location and Product Profiles: Can a single Mention be associated
      with multiple Locations or Products, or is it always one-to-one? → One
      location at a time, but can be multiple products, especially when it 
     is comparison between multiple products. Actually, what do you suggest?
      

⏺ For the Product question — I'd recommend allowing multiple Products per Mention. Here's why:

  - Product comparisons are common ("Product A vs Product B")
  - Reviews often discuss bundles or related products together
  - Brand posts may promote multiple products in one campaign

  Meanwhile, one Location makes sense because physical context is typically singular — a review about a store visit is about that store.

  So: One Location, Multiple Products per Mention.

  Here's the updated data model draft:

  ---
  Entities:

  - Mention — An incoming conversation or post about a brand, captured from social media, web, or surveys
  - Ticket — A customer care case created from one or more mentions, assigned to agents
  - Brand — A monitored brand (your own or competitors) with associated keywords, channels, and profiles
  - Channel — A connected social media platform or web source (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, etc.)
  - Page — A specific social media page within a channel where activity occurs
  - Author — A customer's social media identity on a specific platform
  - Contact — A unified customer profile linking multiple Authors (matched by email/phone)
  - Location Profile — A physical location under a Brand with GMB, surveys, pages, and review channels
  - Product Profile — A product under a Brand with reviews, social pages, and promotional associations
  - User — A team member using the platform (agent, manager, marketer)
  - Team — A group of users with shared permissions and assignments
  - Workspace — A composable view configuration (layouts, filters, columns)
  - Workflow — An automation definition with triggers, conditions, and actions
  - Post — Published content sent to social media channels
  - Report — A saved analytics dashboard or insight view
  - Classification — A custom tag or category applied to mentions

  Relationships:

  - Brand has many Channels, Location Profiles, and Product Profiles
  - Channel has many Pages
  - Page belongs to a Channel and optionally to a Location Profile or Product Profile
  - Mention belongs to a Brand, comes from a Page, and is created by an Author
  - Mention can be associated with one Location Profile and multiple Product Profiles
  - Author always has a Contact
  - Contact has many Authors (unified identity across platforms)
  - Ticket is created from one or more Mentions
  - Ticket belongs to a Brand and is assigned to Users/Teams
  - Workflow belongs to a Brand and triggers actions on Mentions, Tickets, or Posts
  - Post is published to Pages and can be associated with Product Profiles
  - Workspace and Report belong to Users or Teams

  ---
  Does this capture everything? Any adjustments before I save it?

> I also want to have tasks. Tasks can be associated with a ticket, and 
tasks can also be associated with users. There is a situation where tasks 
are required for the publishing workflow, approvals of a post, draft, and 
things like that, which does not actually associate with the ticket. 

⏺ Good addition — Task is a flexible work unit that lives across different contexts:

  - Ticket-related tasks (follow up with customer, escalate issue)
  - Publishing tasks (approve post, review draft)
  - Standalone tasks assigned to users

  Here's the updated model with Task added:

  ---
  Entities:

  - Mention — An incoming conversation or post about a brand, captured from social media, web, or surveys

> A mention could also include a review. Not as another entity, but a type 
of a mention. I think I would also like to model another entity which is the
 replies (replies are or a response as part of a ticket) in association to a
 user mention. There's also one more entity for these are micro entities 
like AI-led response generation and AI agents as an entity which models 
similarly to the user. There needs to also be knowledge article as an 
entity. Knowledge article can be tagged to a product, location, brand, of 
course a social media channel. 

⏺ Great refinements. Let me capture these:

  1. Mention types — Review is a type of Mention (not separate entity), along with social post, web mention, survey response, etc.
  2. Reply — A response to a Mention within a Ticket, sent by a User or AI Agent
  3. AI Agent — An entity modeled like User, representing AI that can generate responses and take actions
  4. Knowledge Article — Reference content tagged to Brand, Product, Location, or Channel for response generation and AI training

  Here's the final data model:

⏺ Let's define the visual identity for Locobuzz CX.

  I'll help you choose:
  1. Colors — A primary accent, secondary accent, and neutral palette
  2. Typography — Fonts for headings, body text, and code

  These will be applied consistently across all your screen designs and the application shell.

  Do you have any existing brand colors or fonts in mind, or would you like suggestions?

> Neutral UI + Indigo accent (clean “CRM” look)
Colors

Primary accent (actions, links, selected states)

primary-600 #4F46E5

primary-700 #4338CA (hover/pressed)

primary-100 #E0E7FF (tints, subtle highlights)

Secondary accent (supporting UI, tags)

secondary-600 #0EA5E9 (sky)

secondary-100 #E0F2FE

Neutrals (Notion-like)

bg #FFFFFF

surface-1 #F8FAFC (page background / panels)

surface-2 #FFFFFF (cards)

border #E5E7EB

border-strong #D1D5DB

text #111827

text-muted #6B7280

text-subtle #9CA3AF

Semantic (status + alerts)

success-600 #16A34A

warning-600 #D97706

danger-600 #DC2626

info-600 #2563EB

Practical usage rules (keeps it minimal)

Use primary only for: primary CTA, active nav item, selected row, links.

Use secondary only for: informational tags, “new/feature” chips, secondary 
charts.

Everything else stays neutral (borders, dividers, tables, backgrounds).

Typography (Recommended stack for “functional + modern”)
Fonts

UI (Headings + Body): Inter (fallback: system-ui, -apple-system, Segoe UI, 
Roboto)

Code / tokens / IDs: JetBrains Mono (fallback: ui-monospace, SFMono-Regular)

Sizes (simple, CRM-friendly)

text-xs 12px (meta labels, timestamps)

text-sm 14px (default body)

text-md 16px (reading-heavy screens)

text-lg 18px (section headers)

text-xl 20–24px (page title only)

Weights (minimal set)

Body: 400

Emphasis: 500

Headings: 600

Line heights

Body: 1.5

Headings: 1.2–1.3 

⏺ This is a well-defined system. Let me map it to Tailwind:

  Your palette:

  | Token     | Tailwind | Usage                                               |
  |-----------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------|
  | Primary   | indigo   | CTAs, active nav, selected states, links            |
  | Secondary | sky      | Informational tags, feature chips, secondary charts |
  | Neutral   | slate    | Backgrounds, text, borders, tables                  |

  Your typography:

  | Role    | Font           | Notes                    |
  |---------|----------------|--------------------------|
  | Heading | Inter          | Weights 500-600          |
  | Body    | Inter          | Weight 400, 14px default |
  | Mono    | JetBrains Mono | Code, tokens, IDs        |

  Here's your design system summary:

  Colors:
  - Primary: indigo — actions, links, selected states
  - Secondary: sky — informational tags, feature chips
  - Neutral: slate — Notion-like clean grays

  Typography:
  - Heading: Inter
  - Body: Inter
  - Mono: JetBrains Mono

⏺ I'm designing the shell for Locobuzz CX. Based on your roadmap, you have 6 sections:

  1. Listening & Inbox — Unified mention stream with composable views
  2. Customer Care — Ticketing and agent workspace
  3. Insights & Analytics — Dashboards and competitive benchmarking
  4. Publishing — Social media content management
  5. Workflows & Integrations — Automation and external handoffs
  6. Settings & Configuration — Brand setup, channels, and preferences

  Let's decide on the shell layout. Common patterns:

  A. Sidebar Navigation — Vertical nav on the left, content on the right
  Best for: Apps with many sections, dashboard-style tools, admin panels

  B. Top Navigation — Horizontal nav at top, content below
  Best for: Simpler apps, marketing-style products, fewer sections

  C. Minimal Header — Just logo + user menu, sections accessed differently
  Best for: Single-purpose tools, wizard-style flows

  Given Locobuzz CX is a Notion-like composable platform with 6 major sections, I'd recommend Sidebar Navigation — it scales well and matches the aesthetic of tools like Notion, Linear, and Intercom.
                                                                          
⏺ User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · Which navigation pattern fits Locobuzz CX best? → Hybrid
     · Should the sidebar be collapsible to icons only? → Yes, collapsible

⏺ Hybrid with collapsible sidebar is a solid choice — gives you branding prominence at the top while keeping navigation accessible.
                                                                           
⏺ User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · What should appear in the top bar alongside the logo? → Logo + Brand 
     Switcher + Command Bar (Search + Actions + Create) + User Menu
     Make Search a universal launcher (⌘/Ctrl+K) that supports 
     jump/create/run/ask, so users don’t navigate— they execute.

     · What should be the default/home view when the app loads? → Home 
     should be composable: “Home = Page + Blocks”

     Home is not a dashboard screen. It’s a layout container where you pin 
     blocks. Each block is a reusable widget connected to objects (Tickets, 
     Mentions, Posts, Alerts, Reports, Tasks).

     System behavior

     Default landing = My Home

     My Home template is selected by:

     user role (Agent / Marketer / Analyst / Admin)

     enabled modules (Care / Communication / Insights)

     brand/workspace context

     User can Customize Home (add/remove/reorder blocks) if permitted.

     Org admins can lock some blocks (compliance/SLA).

     Agent Home (Customer Care role)

     Goal: “start work in 10 seconds”

     Top strip (always visible)

     My Work Today: Assigned tickets (Open / Due / Overdue)

     SLA Risk: count of tickets breaching soon (next 30/60/120 mins)

     Next Best Action: 3-item queue (highest priority + reason)

     Core blocks

     My Queue (table/list)

     filters: assigned to me, awaiting my response, due today

     Task List (ticket tasks + follow-ups)

     quick complete, quick reassign

     Drafts & Pending Approvals (if you support approvals/macros)

     Productivity Snapshot

     resolved today, avg first response time, backlog delta vs yesterday

     Quick Actions (macro buttons)

     “Close as resolved”, “Request details”, “Escalate”, “Add tag”, “Run 
     workflow”

     Optional (collapsed by default)

     Quality/Coaching: CSAT trend, audit feedback, suggested improvements

     Marketer Home (Brand / Communication / Performance role)

     Goal: “see what changed, what needs action, and what to post next”

     Top strip

     Brand Performance Pulse: reach/impressions/engagement delta vs last 
     period

     Alerts: spikes (mentions/negative sentiment/campaign anomalies)

     Top Content: best 3 posts (with “why” signal)

     Core blocks

     Performance Overview

     KPIs + trends (small, not a huge dashboard)

     Alerts & Anomalies Feed

     “Spike in negative comments”, “Competitor outperformed”, “Campaign 
     drop”

     Content Calendar / Upcoming Posts

     scheduled items + gaps (“no posts planned for Thu”)

     Top Themes (Listening → Marketing)

     trending topics, emerging hashtags, audience questions

     Quick Actions

     “Create post”, “Boost/Promote”, “Generate report”, “Share snapshot”

     Optional

     Competitor Watchlist block (if enabled)

     Shared Home building blocks (your no-code primitives)

     These blocks should be the “LEGO” of home:

     Object List (tickets/mentions/posts) with saved filters

     KPI Card Row

     Trend Sparkline

     Alert Feed

     Tasks / Approvals

     Quick Actions / Macros

     Pinned Views (saved tables/boards)

     AI Insight block (summary, next steps, anomalies explanation)

     One clean rule to keep it minimal

     Home shows only:

     What needs action

     What changed

     What to do next

     Everything else is a click away via the Command Bar or pinned views.


⏺ This is an incredibly well-thought-out vision. Let me summarize the shell design:

  Layout Pattern: Hybrid (Top Bar + Collapsible Sidebar)

  Top Bar (left to right):
  - Logo
  - Brand Switcher (dropdown to switch monitored brands)
  - Command Bar (⌘K universal launcher: search, jump, create, run, ask)
  - User Menu

  Sidebar (collapsible to icons):
  - Listening & Inbox
  - Customer Care
  - Insights & Analytics
  - Publishing
  - Workflows & Integrations
  - Settings & Configuration

  Home (Composable):
  - Not a fixed screen — a layout container with pinnable blocks
  - Role-based default templates (Agent, Marketer, Analyst, Admin)
  - Users can customize block layout (if permitted)
  - Admins can lock compliance/SLA blocks

  Block Primitives:
  - Object List (tickets/mentions/posts with saved filters)
  - KPI Card Row
  - Trend Sparkline
  - Alert Feed
  - Tasks / Approvals
  - Quick Actions / Macros
  - Pinned Views
  - AI Insight block

  Responsive Behavior:
  - Desktop: Full sidebar + top bar
  - Tablet: Collapsed sidebar (icons only) + top bar
  - Mobile: Hamburger menu, command bar prominent

  Does this capture everything? Ready for me to create the shell specification and components?

> I would like to change the sidebar. It can start with mentions, then in 
box, the difference between mentions and inboxes. Mentions are just 
mentions. I would like to see inbox where tickets are there. When I do my 
inbox, there is a secondary sidebar that appears with filters such as:
- Filtered views (new tickets, open tickets, recently closed tickets)
- Assigned to me and my team members
- Unassigned tickets
- Custom cues and the information about all the cues that I can see upon 
clicking on which the ticket list view filters to the appropriate selectionI
 can then have in the main sidebar again brand posts which opens a secondary
 sidebar with channel filters. And then I can have alerts, workflows. 
Insights separately, and Analytics or Dashboards separately. Then, Chat with
 Data separately. My application will only be used in web desktop mode, so 
don't worry about responsive behavior. 

⏺ Got it — a more functional sidebar structure with contextual secondary sidebars. Here's the revised design:

  Top Bar:
  - Logo
  - Brand Switcher
  - Command Bar (⌘K)
  - User Menu

  Main Sidebar (Primary Navigation):
  1. Home — Composable role-based dashboard
  2. Mentions — Raw mention stream (no secondary sidebar)
  3. Inbox — Tickets → opens secondary sidebar
  4. Brand Posts — Published content → opens secondary sidebar
  5. Alerts — Alert feed
  6. Workflows — Workflow builder/list
  7. Insights — Qualitative insights
  8. Dashboards — Analytics/reports
  9. Chat with Data — AI-powered data exploration
  10. Settings — Configuration (likely bottom of sidebar)

  Inbox Secondary Sidebar:
  - Filtered Views: New, Open, Recently Closed
  - Assigned to Me
  - Assigned to Team Members
  - Unassigned
  - Custom Queues (expandable list with queue details)

  Brand Posts Secondary Sidebar:
  - Channel filters (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc.)

  Desktop only — no responsive considerations.
                                                                           
⏺ User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · Does this sidebar structure look right? Any items to add, remove, or 
     reorder? → Use the previous answers also and merge them with the new

⏺ I've updated the roadmap to reflect your 10-section structure. Now, which section would you like to shape first?
                                                                           
⏺ User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · Which section would you like to define the specification for? → Home

⏺ Let's define the scope and requirements for Home.

  We discussed this earlier in detail — the composable, role-based dashboard with pinnable blocks. Here's what I captured:

  - Home = Page + Blocks (not a fixed dashboard)
  - Role-based default templates (Agent, Marketer, Analyst, Admin)
  - Users can customize (add/remove/reorder blocks)
  - Admins can lock certain compliance/SLA blocks
  - Block primitives: Object List, KPI Card Row, Trend Sparkline, Alert Feed, Tasks/Approvals, Quick Actions, Pinned Views, AI Insight Block

  Agent Home focus: My Work Today, SLA Risk, Next Best Action, My Queue, Task List, Productivity Snapshot

  Marketer Home focus: Brand Performance Pulse, Alerts, Top Content, Content Calendar, Top Themes

  Do you have any additional thoughts about the Home section, or should I proceed with shaping this into a formal spec?

> yes proceed with the spec 

⏺ Here's the specification for Home:

  ---
  Overview:
  Home is a composable, role-based dashboard where users land after login. Rather than a fixed layout, it's a container of pinnable blocks that surface what needs attention, what changed, and what to do next. Default templates are provided based on user role, with customization allowed within permission boundaries.

  User Flows:
  - User lands on Home after login, sees their role-based default layout
  - User views blocks showing priority items (tickets, alerts, tasks, KPIs)
  - User clicks items within blocks to navigate to relevant sections
  - User customizes Home by adding, removing, or reordering blocks (if permitted)
  - Admin locks specific blocks for compliance/SLA visibility across the org
  - User executes quick actions directly from Home (close ticket, create post, run macro)

  UI Requirements:
  - Layout: Grid-based block container, blocks can span 1-3 columns
  - Block Types:
    - Object List (tickets, mentions, posts with saved filters)
    - KPI Card Row (metrics with trend indicators)
    - Trend Sparkline (mini time-series charts)
    - Alert Feed (real-time alerts and anomalies)
    - Tasks / Approvals (action items requiring attention)
    - Quick Actions / Macros (one-click action buttons)
    - Pinned Views (saved table/board configurations)
    - AI Insight Block (summaries, next steps, anomaly explanations)
  - Top Strip: Always-visible summary row (My Work Today, SLA Risk, Next Best Action for Agents; Performance Pulse, Alerts, Top Content for Marketers)
  - Customization Panel: Slide-out or modal to add/remove/reorder blocks
  - Lock Indicator: Visual badge on admin-locked blocks
  - Empty State: Guided setup for first-time users to configure their Home

  Role Templates:
  - Agent Home: My Queue, Task List, Drafts & Approvals, Productivity Snapshot, Quick Actions
  - Marketer Home: Performance Overview, Alerts & Anomalies, Content Calendar, Top Themes, Quick Actions
  - Analyst Home: KPI Overview, Trend Charts, Competitive Snapshot, AI Insights
  - Admin Home: Team Performance, SLA Compliance, System Alerts, Quick Actions

  Does this capture everything? Ready to save?

> One more object to be added in the list will be knowledge articles. The 
use case here is when a new knowledge article is published or available, the
 home page serves as a best place for agents to discover. It could also 
serve as the product owners to showcase what's new within Locobuzz. Each 
block type can have a block customizer also. Using grid stack like resizable
 blocks to fit the screen, the bigger the block, more information can be 
shown. For example, a bigger KPI row can fit more KPIs with a simple button 
of add KPI or remove KPI. One can add their own KPIs there, the KPIs 
available also permission-driven for agents. It will be their own marketers 
and managers can have a brand-level KPIs. Similar primitives for other 
things:
- Alerts
- Tasks
- Object lists
These can have filters, or it's usually a list view, so one can add other 
columns to the list to show more information of the record in the list. 

⏺ Great additions — Knowledge Articles as a discovery surface, plus deep block-level customization with GridStack-style resizing. Here's the updated specification:

  - Admin locks specific blocks for compliance/SLA visibility across the org
  - User discovers new knowledge articles and product updates via Knowledge Articles block
  - User executes quick actions directly from Home (close ticket, create post, run macro)

  UI Requirements:
  - Layout: GridStack-style resizable block grid, blocks can be dragged to resize
  - Block Sizing: Larger blocks display more information (more KPIs, more list rows, more columns)
  - Block Customizer: Each block has a settings panel to configure its contents

      1 # Home Specification
      2 ## Overview
      3 Home is a composable, role-based dashboard where users land after
         login. Rather than a fixed layout, it's a container of pinnable,
         resizable blocks that surface what needs attention, what changed
        , and what to do next. Default templates are provided based on us
        er role (Agent, Marketer, Analyst, Admin), with customization all
        owed within permission boundaries. Each block type has its own cu
        stomizer for adding/removing content and configuring display. Hom
        e also serves as a discovery surface for new knowledge articles a
        nd product updates.
      4 ## User Flows
      5 - User lands on Home after login, sees their role-based default l
        ayout
      6 - User views blocks showing priority items (tickets, alerts, task
        s, KPIs, knowledge articles)
      7 - User clicks items within blocks to navigate to relevant section
        s
      8 - User resizes blocks (GridStack-style drag to resize) — larger b
        locks show more information
     … +97 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ I've created the specification at product/sections/home/spec.md.

  Summary of what's captured:

  - Overview: Composable, role-based dashboard with pinnable, resizable blocks
  - Layout: GridStack-style resizable grid where bigger blocks show more information
  - Top Strip: Always-visible role-contextual summary (Agent: Work/SLA/Next Action; Marketer: Performance/Alerts/Top Content)
  - 9 Block Types: Object List, KPI Card Row, Trend Sparkline, Alert Feed, Tasks/Approvals, Quick Actions, Pinned Views, AI Insight Block, Knowledge Articles
  - Block Customizer: Each block has its own settings (add/remove items, filters, columns)
  - Permission-Driven: Agent KPIs vs brand-level KPIs, role-targeted content
  - Admin Controls: Lock blocks for compliance/SLA visibility
  - 4 Role Templates: Agent, Marketer, Analyst, Admin
  - Design Principle: Show only what needs action, what changed, what to do next

  Next step: Run /sample-data to create sample data for the Home section, or run /shape-section again to define another section.

⏺ I found the Home specification and your global data model. Let me organize the sample data structure.

  Based on the specification and your data model, here's how I'm organizing the data:

  Entities (from your data model):
  - Ticket — Customer care cases for the My Queue block
  - Task — Action items for the Tasks/Approvals block
  - Mention — Conversations for Object List blocks
  - Post — Published content for Top Content and Content Calendar
  - Knowledge Article — Reference content for the Knowledge Articles block
  - User — Team members for assignment context

  Section-specific data:
  - KPI — Metrics with values and trend indicators
  - Alert — Real-time alerts and anomalies
  - TopStripSummary — Role-specific summary stats (Agent vs Marketer)
  - QuickAction — Available macro buttons
  - Block — Block configuration with type, size, and settings

  Sample Data:
  I'll create realistic records for an Agent Home view:
  - 8 tickets in My Queue (varied statuses, priorities, SLA states)
  - 6 tasks (mix of ticket tasks and approvals)
  - 5 alerts (different severities and types)
  - 6 KPIs (personal performance metrics)
  - 4 knowledge articles (including "What's New")
  - Quick actions for common agent workflows

  Does this structure make sense? Any adjustments before I generate the files?

⏺ I've created two files for Home:

  1. product/sections/home/data.json — Sample data with:
  - Current user (Agent persona)
  - Top Strip data (Agent & Marketer variants)
  - 8 tickets in My Queue (varied statuses, priorities, SLA states)
  - 6 tasks (follow-ups, approvals, escalations)
  - 5 alerts (SLA breach, mention spike, VIP mention, etc.)
  - 6 KPIs (Resolved Today, Avg First Response, CSAT, SLA Compliance, etc.)
  - 4 knowledge articles (including "What's New")
  - 6 quick actions with keyboard shortcuts
  - 4 posts (published + pending approval)
  - 6 block configurations with GridStack positions

  2. product/sections/home/types.ts — TypeScript interfaces including:
  - Ticket, Task, Alert, Kpi, KnowledgeArticle, Post, Block
  - TopStripAgent, TopStripMarketer for role-specific top strips
  - HomeProps — Main component props with callbacks for all actions
  - Block-specific props: KpiCardRowProps, ObjectListProps, TaskListProps, AlertFeedProps, QuickActionsProps, KnowledgeArticlesProps

  The types include callbacks for:
  - Viewing/completing tickets and tasks
  - Alert actions and dismissal
  - Block resize, reorder, add, remove, customize
  - Quick action execution
  - Navigation

  Next step: Run /design-screen to create the screen design for the Home section.

⏺ All prerequisites are in place. The Home section has your design tokens (indigo/sky/slate) and will render inside the application shell.

  This is a complex dashboard with multiple block types. I'll create the Agent Home view since that's what the sample data is configured for. Let me build a production-grade, composable dashboard.

⏺ I've created the screen design for Home (Agent Dashboard).

  Exportable components (props-based, portable):
  - src/sections/home/components/Home.tsx — Main dashboard component
  - src/sections/home/components/TopStripAgent.tsx — Always-visible summary row
  - src/sections/home/components/BlockWrapper.tsx — Reusable block container with header
  - src/sections/home/components/KpiCardRow.tsx — KPI metrics block
  - src/sections/home/components/MyQueue.tsx — Ticket queue block
  - src/sections/home/components/TaskList.tsx — Tasks/approvals block
  - src/sections/home/components/AlertFeed.tsx — Alerts block
  - src/sections/home/components/QuickActions.tsx — Quick action buttons block
  - src/sections/home/components/KnowledgeArticles.tsx — Knowledge base block
  - src/sections/home/components/index.ts — Component exports

  Preview wrapper (for Design OS only):
  - src/sections/home/HomePreview.tsx

  Design features:
  - Top Strip: My Work Today (open/due/overdue), SLA Risk (color-coded breaching timers), Next Best Actions (priority-ordered with reasons)
  - KPI Cards: Metrics with trend indicators, target comparison, add KPI button
  - My Queue: Tickets with priority badges, SLA status, channel icons, VIP indicators, sentiment dots
  - Task List: Checkable tasks with type icons, priority dots, due date countdown
  - Alert Feed: Severity-coded alerts with unread/read states, actionable buttons
  - Quick Actions: Color-coded action buttons with keyboard shortcuts
  - Knowledge Articles: Featured/new articles with gradient cards, read time

  Applied your design tokens:
  - Primary: indigo — buttons, active states, primary accents
  - Secondary: sky — info tags, secondary highlights
  - Neutral: slate — backgrounds, text, borders

  Important: Restart your dev server (npm run dev) to see the changes. The screen will render inside your application shell.

  Next steps:
  - Run /screenshot-design to capture a screenshot for documentation
  - Run /shape-section to design another section (Mentions, Inbox, etc.)
  - When all sections are complete, run /export-product to generate the export package

> Unknown slash command: screenshot-design 

> npm run dev 

⏺ The /screenshot-design command isn't available in this Design OS installation. That's okay — you can take screenshots manually if needed.

  The dev server is now running. You should be able to see the Home screen design at http://localhost:3000 — it will render inside your application shell with the Agent Dashboard layout.

  Available next steps:
  - Run /shape-section to design another section (Inbox, Mentions, Dashboards, etc.)
  - When all sections are complete, run /export-product to generate the export package
