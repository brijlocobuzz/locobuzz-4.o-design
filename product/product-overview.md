# Locobuzz CX

## Description
Locobuzz CX is a unified, AI-native, and fully composable customer experience platform with a Notion-like interface. Marketing and customer care teams can monitor brand conversations, respond through intelligent ticketing, collaborate across the organization, and publish content—all on a no-code platform where workspaces, views, workflows, AI agents, and analytics are endlessly customizable to fit exactly how each team works.

## Problems & Solutions

### Problem 1: Fragmented tools
One unified platform for listening, ticketing, analytics, and publishing eliminates tool sprawl.

### Problem 2: Missed conversations
Authenticated API connections combined with keyword scanning ensure no mention goes unnoticed across social media and the web.

### Problem 3: Slow response times
AI-powered auto-ticketing and conversation bundling accelerate customer care workflows.

### Problem 4: Lack of insights
Sentiment analysis, intent classification, and competitive benchmarking provide actionable intelligence.

### Problem 5: Broken cross-team handoffs
Integrations with work management systems hand off customer-originated tasks to the right teams with full context, and bring updates back into the conversation thread for crafting informed responses.

### Problem 6: CX tools aren't ready for agentic AI
Built AI-native from the ground up—ambient co-pilot assistance, automated task execution, and AI that learns from your actions to work autonomously when authorized.

### Problem 7: Every CX tool misses last-mile customization
A no-code, composable platform with Notion-like flexibility—teams build their own workspaces, views, workflows, AI agent flows, and dashboards so the tool adapts to their work, not the other way around.
